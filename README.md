### Development instructions
While developing this application, the team should follow theses strict workflow

### Quick guide for git hub

1. Before starting code open a new branch for work. Branch must call `custom` + and number example: `custom1`, `custom2`, `custom3` open new branch -> `git branch -b branchName`
2. After done your work you need to add your works with `git add .`
3. Then commit your works, in massage  you need write your branch name then write your changes example: `custom1/ navigation page updated` commit command: `git commit -m "custom1/ your changes"`
4. After commit always back to main branch and get new changes from main then go to your branch then push  your banches to your BRANCH not main! examples bellow
5. back to main Branch by this code: `git checkout main`,  get new changes from main by this code: `git pull origin HEAD`, after get new changes back to your branch by this code `git checkout yourBranchName`,  then push  your changes to your branch by this code `git push origin yourBranchName` 
6. your changes seccessfully pushed to your branch !  Once your changes was tested by tester or reviewed by me, I will marge this changes to main branch

IMPORTANT NOTE: before pushing any changes to origin you must make sure that you are not pushing to `main` branch. And do not merge your PR too! These can be done only by me (JasurJorayev).
